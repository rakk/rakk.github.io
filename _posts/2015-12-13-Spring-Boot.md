title: Spring Boot
---

At my work we consider using Spring Boot as the new production platform for our current and new projects. My experience with Spring Boot was minimal so I decided to learn more about this project.
I like to start learning new technologies by watching some demo/presentation first. I started watching some and almost fall asleep.
Fortunately I found Josh Long's presentation. Enjoy it.
